Overview
--------

The goals of development and production builds differ greatly. In development, we want strong source mapping and a localhost server with live reloading or hot module replacement. In production, our goals shift to a focus on minified bundles, lighter weight source maps, and optimized assets to improve load time.

We will write separate webpack configurations for each environment.

We will have 3 configurtions :
* production
* development
* common


With the "common" configuration in place, we won't have to duplicate code within the environment-specific configurations.


In order to merge these configurations together, we'll use a utility called *webpack-merge*

Steps
-----

= Install webpack-merge =

$ npm install --save-dev webpack-merge


Why Babel
---------
Needed to transpiler edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser (even the old ones).

* babel-core: contains the core API.
* babel-preset-env: automatically determines the Babel plugins and polyfills you need based on your targeted browser or runtime environments.
* babel-preset-stage-3: any transforms in stage-x presets are changes to the language that havenâ€™t been approved to be part of a release of Javascript (such as ES6/ES2015).

Install babel required modules
------------------------------

npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-preset-env babel-preset-stage-3

Tip: "npm i -D" is a shorter alias for "npm install-save-dev"

What is a Babel preset?
-----------------------

In Babel, a preset is a set of plugins used to support particular language features.

To configure babel you have to create the following file *.babelrc*

Why webpack
-----------

Installation webpack
--------------------

We will be using the following Webpack libraries:

* webpack
* webpack-cli: encapsulates all code related to command line interface handling.
* webpack-dev-server: serves a webpack app and updates the browser on changes.

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
